Simple portfolio tracking dashboard using Google Sheets and Looker Studio

# Introduction
As an investor, I consider essential to have a dashboard to monitor our investments, not only to assess portfolio performance but also to analyze its evolution over time. Investing in different markets (US and Argentina) and other assets outside the traditional markets such as Crypto, posed a challenge in finding a platform that allows me to analyze all my investments and their holistic evolution. While the US broker's application provides visibility into performance, it rarely includes assets from the Argentine stock exchange (and vice versa). Additionally, it does not provide quotes for crypto assets. My motivation was to create a tool that could provide analysis of returns and evolution of my entire portfolio.
